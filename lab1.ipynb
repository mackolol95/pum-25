    "> **Python standard library** is a collection of basic functions that always come pre-installed with Python. Think of it as a with a hammer, a screwdriver, and some zipties. Those tools you can absolutely use to build something useful, but it will probably take you some time and effort. The standard library is exactly what you learn during the basic Python courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A python **package** is a collection of useful functions and methods that allow you to perform many interesting tasks without writing your code from scratch. Packages are created by the Python community (which includes you and me) and have to be installed separately. You can think of a package as an electric drill. Someone has already done the hard work of building the drill, and now you can use it to make holes in the wall much faster than if you were to do it by hand. In this course, we will be using packages built for easy data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.\n",

    "### *Python type hinting\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to use Python type hints when defining functions. Type hints are a way to specify the expected types of the function arguments and the return value. This can help you catch bugs early and make your code easier to understand. For example, the function `get_median` can be defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_median(numbers: list[float]) -> float:\n",
    "    # This function takes a list of floats as input and returns a float\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python ignores these type hints, so they do not affect the performance of your code. However, they are an elegant way to document your code and make it more readable. By just looking at the definition, you can quickly understand what the function does and what kind of arguments it expects, thus making it easier to include your functions in larger projects. You can read more about type hints in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)."
